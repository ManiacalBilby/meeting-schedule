## Hourly Schedule
This is an hourly schedule application built using react and redux.

## Deployed on Heroku

Try it out [here](https://time-slots.herokuapp.com/)

## Running the app

[Clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) or [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the repo.

npm start runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Using the App

When you click a time slot a modal form will appear with name and phone number fields. Complete and submit the form in order to schedule an appointment. Pressing escape will allow you to exit the modal.

After submitting the modal form, the time slot will turn red to indicate the appointment has been booked. Click the time slot again to open the form and edit the information.

## What I learned

This challenge allowed me to get some more hands on experience using Redux, and to learn more about how it handles the flow of data within React. 

When I got stuck I would review any errors, read the Redux docs, search in stackoverflow, read blog posts etc. If I remained stuck, I would reach out to another developer to work through the issue I was facing.

This project was bootstrapped with a redux-boilerplate that included [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
